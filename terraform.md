# Terraform

## What is Terraform?

When you provision infrastructure manually — clicking through the AWS console, running CLI commands — it doesn't scale. You can't version it, reproduce it, or hand it to a teammate and get the same result.

**Terraform** is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool — IaC means you describe what infrastructure you want in code files, and Terraform creates, updates, or destroys it to match. The same benefits that code gives you over manual work apply directly here.

> In Ansible: you describe how to configure servers.  
> In Terraform: you describe what infrastructure should exist.

Terraform works with dozens of platforms — AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes — through **providers**.

---

## Why IaC? Why Terraform?

**1. Version control your infrastructure**

Your `.tf` files live in git. You get the full history of every change — who changed what, when, and why. You can review infrastructure changes in a PR just like application code, and roll back if something goes wrong.

**2. Consistent environments**

The same Terraform code that creates your DEV environment creates UAT and PROD. No more "it works in dev but not prod" caused by someone clicking through the console differently. Every environment is a known, reproducible state.

**3. Cost optimisation**

Because spinning up and tearing down is just `terraform apply` and `terraform destroy`, you only pay for what you actually need. Spin up a full environment for testing, destroy it when the test is done. No forgotten instances running over the weekend.

**4. Reusable infrastructure — Modules**

Terraform lets you package infrastructure into **modules** — reusable units you can call with different inputs. Write the VPC setup once, use it across five projects by just changing the variables. Same idea as functions in programming.

**5. Inventory management (CRUD)**

Terraform's state file (`terraform.tfstate`) is a live inventory of everything it manages — what exists, its attributes, its relationships. You always know exactly what's out there. No more spreadsheets or tribal knowledge about what's running where.

**6. Dependency management**

Terraform figures out the order to create resources automatically. If an EC2 instance needs a security group, Terraform creates the security group first — you don't have to think about it. Reference one resource from another (`aws_security_group.name.id`) and Terraform builds the dependency graph for you.

---

## Providers

A **provider** is like a plugin that tells Terraform how to interact with a platform's API.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "6.48.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

- `terraform {}` block declares which providers your code needs
- `provider "aws" {}` block configures the provider (region, credentials, etc.)
- `terraform init` downloads the provider and creates a lock file (`.terraform.lock.hcl`)

You never call the provider directly — Terraform calls it for you when you run `apply`.

---

## HCL — HashiCorp Configuration Language

Terraform files use **HCL** (HashiCorp Configuration Language). Everything in HCL is a **block**:

```hcl
block_type "label1" "label2" {
  argument = value
}
```

The main block types you'll use:

| Block | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `terraform` | Provider requirements and backend config |
| `provider` | Configure a provider (region, credentials) |
| `resource` | Create infrastructure |
| `variable` | Input values (DRY — avoid hardcoding) |
| `output` | Print values after apply |
| `locals` | Intermediate computed values |
| `data` | Read existing infrastructure (not create) |

---

## resource Block

The most common block. Declares a piece of infrastructure to create.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "terraform_demo" {
  ami           = "ami-0220d79f3f480ecf5"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name        = "terraform-demo-1"
    Project     = "roboshop"
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}
```

- `"aws_instance"` — the type of resource (provider\_resourcetype)
- `"terraform_demo"` — your name for it (used to reference it elsewhere in code)
- Arguments inside the block are the resource's configuration

**Reference another resource's attribute:**

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "terraform_demo" {
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.allow_terraform.id]  # reference SG by name
}
```

`aws_security_group.allow_terraform.id` means: from the resource of type `aws_security_group` named `allow_terraform`, get the `id` attribute. Terraform figures out the dependency order automatically.

---

## Core Commands

```bash
terraform init      # download providers, create lock file
terraform plan      # show what will be created/updated/destroyed
terraform apply     # make it happen (prompts for confirmation)
terraform apply -auto-approve   # skip the confirmation prompt
terraform destroy -auto-approve # destroy all resources
```

**Typical workflow:**

1. Write `.tf` files
2. `terraform init` — sets up the working directory
3. `terraform plan` — review before you act
4. `terraform apply` — create/update resources
5. `terraform destroy` — tear down when done

Terraform stores what it created in `terraform.tfstate`. Never delete this file — it's how Terraform knows what exists.

---

## Variables

Variables make your code DRY — replace hardcoded values with names you can change from outside.

```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  type    = string
  default = "t3.micro"
}
```

Use a variable with `var.`:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "terraform_demo" {
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}
```

### Data types

```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  type = string        # "t3.micro"
}

variable "port" {
  type = number        # 8080
}

variable "cidr" {
  type = list(string)  # ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}

variable "ec2_tags" {
  type = map           # { Name = "demo", Env = "dev" }
}
```

### Validation

You can reject bad values before Terraform even tries to create anything:

```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  type = string

  validation {
    condition     = contains(["t3.micro", "t3.small", "t3.medium", "t3.large"], var.instance_type)
    error_message = "Instance type should be either t3.micro or t3.small"
  }
}
```

---

## Variable Precedence (highest → lowest)

You can set a variable's value in four different ways. When the same variable is set in multiple places, this is the winner:

```
1. Command-line      terraform apply -var="instance_type=t3.large"
2. terraform.tfvars  instance_type = "t3.medium"
3. Environment var   export TF_VAR_instance_type=t3.small
4. default           default = "t3.micro"
5. prompt            (Terraform asks if no value is found)
```

**Example:** if you set `default = "t3.micro"`, export `TF_VAR_instance_type=t3.small`, and add `instance_type = "t3.medium"` to `terraform.tfvars`, the command-line `-var` wins. If you don't pass it on CLI, `terraform.tfvars` wins.

### terraform.tfvars

A file Terraform automatically loads to set variable values:

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
instance_type = "t3.medium"
```

Anything in this file overrides `default` but loses to CLI `-var`.

---

## Conditions (Ternary)

No `if/else` blocks in Terraform — use the ternary expression:

```hcl
expression ? "true-value" : "false-value"
```

Real example — use `t3.micro` for dev, `t3.small` for everything else:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "terraform_demo" {
  instance_type = var.environment == "dev" ? "t3.micro" : "t3.small"
}
```

If `var.environment` is `"dev"` → `"t3.micro"`. Any other value → `"t3.small"`.

---

## Loops

### count — list-based loops

`count` creates multiple copies of a resource. The current index is `count.index` (starts at 0).

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "roboshop" {
  count         = 4
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type

  tags = {
    Name = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-${var.instances[count.index]}"
  }
}
```

With `var.instances = ["mongodb", "redis", "mysql", "rabbitmq"]` this creates four EC2 instances named:
- `roboshop-dev-mongodb`
- `roboshop-dev-redis`
- `roboshop-dev-mysql`
- `roboshop-dev-rabbitmq`

`${...}` is **string interpolation** — embed an expression inside a string.

**Reference a specific resource from a count group:**

```hcl
vpc_security_group_ids = [
  aws_security_group.roboshop[count.index].id,  # the SG for this instance
  aws_security_group.common.id                   # a shared SG for all instances
]
```

`aws_security_group.roboshop` is now a list (because it also has `count = 4`), so you access it by index.

### for_each — map-based loops

`count` works on lists and tracks resources by position number. `for_each` works on **maps** and tracks resources by their key name — which makes updates much safer.

The special variable `each` gives you:
- `each.key` — the map key (e.g. `"mongodb"`)
- `each.value` — the map value (e.g. `{ instance_type = "t3.micro" }`)

```hcl
# variables.tf
variable "instances" {
  type = map
  default = {
    mongodb  = { instance_type = "t3.micro" }
    redis    = { instance_type = "t3.micro" }
    mysql    = { instance_type = "t3.micro" }
    frontend = { instance_type = "t3.micro" }
  }
}
```

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "roboshop" {
  for_each      = var.instances
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = each.value.instance_type

  tags = {
    Name = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-${each.key}"
    # → "roboshop-dev-mongodb", "roboshop-dev-frontend", etc.
  }
}
```

`aws_instance.roboshop` is now a **map** of resources keyed by component name. Reference an entry by key:

```hcl
vpc_security_group_ids = [
  aws_security_group.roboshop[each.key].id,
  aws_security_group.common.id
]
```

**count vs for_each:**

| | `count` | `for_each` |
|---|---|---|
| Input | list | map |
| Current item | `count.index` (number) | `each.key` / `each.value` |
| Resource address | `aws_instance.x[0]` | `aws_instance.x["mongodb"]` |
| Remove middle item | renumbers everything below it | only removes that one key |


---

## String Interpolation

Embed expressions inside strings with `${}`:

```hcl
Name = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-${var.instances[count.index]}"
# → "roboshop-dev-mongodb"
```

---

## output Block

`output` prints values after `terraform apply` and exposes them to other modules.

```hcl
output "ec2_instance_output" {
  value = aws_instance.roboshop
}
```

```bash
terraform output                        # show all outputs
terraform output ec2_instance_output    # show a specific output
```

Outputs are also how modules pass values to the code that calls them — the caller reads them as `module.name.output_name`.

---

## Functions

Terraform has many built-in functions. You can't create custom ones — only use what's provided.

### contains — check if an element exists

```hcl
contains(["t3.micro", "t3.small", "t3.medium"], var.instance_type)
# → true or false

contains(keys(var.instances), "frontend")
# → true if "frontend" is a key in the map
```

Used in variable validation and in conditionals (ternary + count) to check whether something should be created.

### index — find position of an element

```hcl
index(var.instances, "frontend")   # → 9 (zero-based position in the list)
```

### join and split — string ↔ list

```hcl
join(" ", ["Sivakumar", "Reddy", "Mettukuru"])
# → "Sivakumar Reddy Mettukuru"

split(" ", "Sivakumar Reddy Mettukuru")
# → ["Sivakumar", "Reddy", "Mettukuru"]
```

### length — count items

```hcl
length(var.instances)   # number of items in a list or map
```

### keys — get all keys of a map

```hcl
keys(var.instances)
# → ["cart", "catalogue", "frontend", "mongodb", "mysql", ...]
```

### merge — combine maps

Right side wins on duplicate keys:

```hcl
merge(
  { a = "b", c = "d" },
  { c = "z", e = "f" }
)
# → { a = "b", c = "z", e = "f" }
```

**Real pattern — common tags + resource-specific tags:**

Instead of duplicating `Project` and `Environment` in every resource, put shared tags in a variable and merge:

```hcl
variable "common_tags" {
  default = {
    Project     = "roboshop"
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}
```

```hcl
tags = merge(
  var.common_tags,
  {
    Name      = "terraform-demo"
    Component = "catalogue"
  }
)
# → { Project = "roboshop", Environment = "dev", Name = "terraform-demo", Component = "catalogue" }
```

Change `common_tags` once, all resources pick it up.

### lookup — get a value from a map by key

```hcl
lookup(aws_instance.roboshop, "frontend").public_ip
# → the public IP of the frontend instance
```

Useful when iterating over a `for_each` resource group and you need to pull a specific entry by name.

---

## lifecycle

Terraform's default behaviour when a resource attribute changes: **destroy first, then recreate**. This can cause downtime — if a security group is renamed, Terraform tries to delete the old one first, but it's still attached to an EC2 instance, so the deletion fails.

`create_before_destroy` flips the order:

```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "roboshop" {
  for_each = var.instances
  name     = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-${each.key}"

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

What happens when the SG name changes:
1. New SG created with the new name
2. Instance's SG attachment updated to point at the new SG
3. Old SG destroyed (safely — nothing is attached to it)

Without this, step 3 runs first and fails because the instance still holds a reference.

---

## Real-World Example: Roboshop — EC2 + SG + Route53

All 10 roboshop components, each with its own EC2 instance, its own security group, a private DNS record, and a public DNS record for just the frontend.

```hcl
# variables.tf
variable "instances" {
  type = map
  default = {
    mongodb   = { instance_type = "t3.micro" }
    redis     = { instance_type = "t3.micro" }
    mysql     = { instance_type = "t3.micro" }
    rabbitmq  = { instance_type = "t3.micro" }
    catalogue = { instance_type = "t3.micro" }
    user      = { instance_type = "t3.micro" }
    cart      = { instance_type = "t3.micro" }
    shipping  = { instance_type = "t3.micro" }
    payment   = { instance_type = "t3.micro" }
    frontend  = { instance_type = "t3.micro" }
  }
}

variable "common_tags" {
  default = {
    Project     = "roboshop"
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}
```

```hcl
# main.tf
resource "aws_instance" "roboshop" {
  for_each      = var.instances
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = each.value.instance_type

  vpc_security_group_ids = [
    aws_security_group.roboshop[each.key].id,
    aws_security_group.common.id
  ]

  tags = merge(var.common_tags, {
    Name      = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-${each.key}"
    Component = each.key
  })
}

resource "aws_security_group" "roboshop" {
  for_each    = var.instances
  name        = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-${each.key}"
  description = "Allow traffic for ${each.key}"

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = merge(var.common_tags, { Name = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-${each.key}" })

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "common" {
  name = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-common"

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = merge(var.common_tags, { Name = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-common" })

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

```hcl
# r53.tf — private DNS record for every component
resource "aws_route53_record" "roboshop" {
  for_each = aws_instance.roboshop
  zone_id  = var.zone_id
  name     = "${each.key}-${var.environment}.${var.domain_name}"
  # → mongodb-dev.daws90s.shop, redis-dev.daws90s.shop, etc.
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = 1
  records = [each.value.private_ip]
}

# public DNS record for frontend only — created conditionally
resource "aws_route53_record" "frontend" {
  count   = contains(keys(var.instances), "frontend") ? 1 : 0
  zone_id = var.zone_id
  name    = "${var.project}-${var.environment}.${var.domain_name}"
  # → roboshop-dev.daws90s.shop
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = 1
  records = [lookup(aws_instance.roboshop, "frontend").public_ip]
}
```

```hcl
# outputs.tf
output "ec2_instance_output" {
  value = aws_instance.roboshop
}
```

What this creates: 10 EC2 instances + 10 per-component SGs + 1 common SG + 10 private Route53 records + 1 public Route53 record for the frontend. All consistently named, all tracked by Terraform state.
